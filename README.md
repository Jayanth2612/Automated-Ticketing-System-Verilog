# Automated-Ticketing-System-Verilog
This project implements a **Verilog-based simulation of an automated ticketing system**.  
The system provides ticket selection, payment handling, change processing, and output display on a simulated 7-segment interface.  
It demonstrates **modular digital design** principles and uses a testbench for validation.
